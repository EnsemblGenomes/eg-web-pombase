<h2 id="about" class="first">About the <em>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</em> genome</h2>
<p class="space-below"><em>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</em>, or fission yeast, is a single celled free-living ascomycete fungus with many of the features found in the cells of multicellular eukaryotes. It provides an excellent model organism for the study of a number of eukaryotic processes, particularly cell cycle control, DNA repair and recombination, centromere structure and function.</p>

<h3 id="annotation">Annotation</h3>
<p class="space-below">The fission yeast genome was published in 2002; Genome size is ~14.1Mb and there are ~5000 annotated protein coding genes and ~1600 annotated RNA genes. The canonical sequence and annotation of the fission yeast genome is maintained by <a href="http://www.pombase.org/">PomBase.org</a>. The genome sequence was released in 2007, but excludes the tandem DNA repeats on chromosome 3, and 4 gaps remain in the centromeres and telomeres which are represented by 100Ns.</p>
<p class="space-below">The annotations are as of release v38 of PomBase from October 2013</p>
